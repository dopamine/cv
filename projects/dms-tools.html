  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-7 offset-1">
      <p>
        Between 2011-2014 I managed a team of XSLT developers and looked after a high-availability component (DMS) that batch generated Sky’s automated correspondence.
      </p><p>
        It was an obscure area nobody outside our team knew, and my workload was hampered by business &amp; technology queries from across the organisation.

  <h2>Solution</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-5 offset-1">
      <p>I designed and implemented a reporting framework that initially presents the user with a simple interface serving the most common tasks, but opens up into more complex reports for advanced users.</p>

      <p>Along with the tool, I created a presentation aimed at senior stakeholders within Sky, one that I could quickly pull out and present on a tablet in meetings to raise DMSTools’s profile. It summarises the need and the feature set, but I also go into more detail on my process of designing and developing it, and how I iterated the design.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6 offset-6">
      <p>DMSTools quickly became the go-to toolkit for Test Analysts and Business Analysts across the business. My team’s productivity increased significantly as we no longer had to deal with frequent queries from across the business.</p>
